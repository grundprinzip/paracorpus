# Parallel Corpus Search

This is a small set of python scripts that allows to search a parallel corpus.
The basic prerequisite is that the data must be available in an aligned form.
This means that the parallel corpus files must be in different subdirectories
and there each file name has a replica in the other language. In addition
each line in the one language has a representation in the other file.
