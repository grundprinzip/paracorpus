# Parallel Corpus Search

This is a small set of python scripts that allows to search a parallel corpus.
The basic prerequisite is that the data must be available in an aligned form.
This means that the parallel corpus files must be in different subdirectories
and there each file name has a replica in the other language. In addition
each line in the one language has a representation in the other file.

For its UI the program uses QT and PyQt4 so you have to install it
first. For Mac and Linux download the Qt framework libraries from 

http://www.qtsoftware.com/downloads

Afterwards you will need to build and install the PyQt4 Wrapper from

Using Windows is much simpler, just install

and be happy.
